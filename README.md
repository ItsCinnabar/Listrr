# What Listrr does
Listrr creates lists for shows and movies based on your filters. The created lists get updated every 24 hours based on your filters, so Listrr will add all new items that match your filters, and will also remove all items that do not match your filter configuration anymore.

# This fork?

Specifically its an untouched fork from before Ultimate decided to be greedy and require you to pay him to gain features. Not even new features, just locked current ones randomly behind a paywall. Well, this fork still works if you self host!

# What can I use this for ?

## Traktarr
You can create lists with listrr and add them to your traktarr configuration. Traktarr automatically adds the items to your *arr instances.

## Python-PlexLibrary
You can create libraries from your the trakt lists you created with Listrr. As your lists get updated every 24 hours, so does your libraries
